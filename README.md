# fish-finder

Python script that uses selenium to web scrape and download all collected stream data containing Brook Trout in the state of Connecticut.

This script scrolls through and downloads all stream .cvs files then merges all the downloaded files into one file.
When the script is finished downloading all the files then sorts the data from most to least Brook Trout count.
